                                        <a>By Local Newspaper</a>
                                        <a>Cooking</a>
                                    </div>

<p>1)</p> The first step on the way to becoming  a master chef is very simple! You have to make sure you have all of your materials and ingredients ready before you start cooking. This includes the measuring, peeling, pan greasing, and more.

By having everything prepared in advance, the cooking is made ten times easier. There will be no panicked searching during the meal-making. Not only does this reduce stress, it makes cooking so much more enjoyable! As long as you have everything on your to-do list your stress will go down and the meal will be better as it was made with planning and precision!

<p>2)</p> When making a dish with meat in it you have to let it rest! For a few minutes after it is done cooking, it is very important to let the meat sit. 

For example, if you cut open a steak right after it is finished cooking, you are letting all of the delicious juices run out of the meat. By letting the steak sit for a few minutes, the juices are able to distribute throughout the steak so when you cut it open, they will not run out. 

<p>3)</p> You have to make sure all of your vegetables are cut evenly! If you do not properly cut your veggies into same-sized chunks, it can ruin the texture of your dish. 

With different sized pieces they will also finish cooking at different times. You may very well end up with some raw vegetable in your dish as well as some veggie bits cooked to mush. It may be painstaking but the time you put into cutting your ingredients is crucial to the textural integrity of the dish.

<p>4)</p>Using salt throughout the cooking process is key for bringing out the flavors! When you are making a home-cooked meal with fresh ingredients the sodium level is already very low. 
By adding salt, you are helping to bring out the flavors in your dish. This is because salt helps suppress bitter flavors, and in the process, makes the sweeter flavors seem stronger. All in all adding salt to your dish is a a key step in enhancing the flavor!

<p>5)</p> As you are going along cooking make sure to taste test every step of the way! As any professional chef will tell you it’s important to know what the dish tastes like before it goes out.
Even though the “going out” is just to your own plate it is imperative to taste test as you go so that you can course correct if you catch something going wrong. Whether it’s adding more of an ingredient or not adding any more of another, by tasting as you go, you may be able to save your dish before it’s ruined!

                                    </div>
                                    <p>Of our several recipes, I think it's important to take a minute to indulge ourselves in a deeper view of our most famous dishes. Our best selling dishes, in order are our Spring Rolls, Orange Chicken and the Classic Summer Pudding.</p>
                                    <p>Our Spring Rolls have been flying off the stove because of our chef's experience with Eurasian dishes. The Spring rolls are made using Spring Roll Wrappers. Our signature egg wraps create the best texture for any vegetable spring roll. The most important thing to remember when making these fine dishes is to never overstuff. All in takes is one overstuffed spring roll to ruin an entire batch. As long as you follow all the steps of a trusted chef, you'll be guaranteed the best spring rolls of your life.</p>
                                    <p>The orange chicken we make is one of the most esteemed dishes in the pacific northwest. The most important aspect of any asian chicken dish, is the sauce. If your sauce is good enough, you can probably get away with slight over or undercook of the actual chicken; But Fusion Food suggests you cook the chicken correctly anyways. The key to the sauce lies in the perfection cooking. It can not be rushed. The longer you simmer the sauce on the stove at a lower temperature the thicker the end result is.</p>
                                    <p>The Classic Summer Pudding is our best selling dessert and after one bite you will quickly realize why. Its creamy structure make it so desirable. The most important aspect of any pudding is the filling. Using the right filling is essential; if you use a too thick or too watery one you pudding is destined to fail. </p>

                                    <div class="blog_author">
                                        <a>By Local Newspaper</a>
                                        <a>Cooking</a>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>The four best foods you could ever eat for your mind and body are: cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. Their unmatched ability to replenish electrolytes and boost your energy has earned them their places on this list.</p>
                                    <p>Cucumbers are an essential aspect to any strong diet. Due to the fact that they are mostly made of water, they are a great way to get natural electrolytes and stay hydrated throughout the day.</p>
                                    <p> Cabbage is a fundamental green vegetable. Despite its absurdly low calorie count, cabbage provides so much nutritional value. Cabbage are high in vitamins C and K, and it is a great addition to any meal as it contains no cholesterol and is naturally low in calories.</p>
                                    <p> We all grew up hearing about how eating carrots would help us see better and increase our vision capabilities. Well, thats entirely true. The benefits of carrots are almost unmatched. I would find any excuse to eat carrots everyday.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, who doesn't love broccoli when it does so much for us. Broccoli is such an effective cleanser of the body that helps replenish our systems when they are running low on anything. Broccoli is high in many nutrients, including fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, iron and potassium. Broccoli also contains more protein than most other vegetables. </p>
